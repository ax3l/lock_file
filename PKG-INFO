Description: 
        Lock file is a traditional means of synchronization among processes. In
        this module it is implemented as an empty regular file exclusively
        locked using fcntl.lockf. When it is to be released it is removed by
        default. However, if all cooperating processes turn off the removal,
        they get a guaranteed order of acquisitions and better scalability.
