Version 2.0:
    Released: 2007-10-24

    New features:
        Use of fcntl.flock has been replaced by fcntl.lockf for better
        portability.

        Removing the lock file before its releasing has been made optional.
        The required behavior can now be set at the LockFile instance creation
        time.

    Fixed bugs:
        Lock file creation mode has been changed to 0666. Previously it was
        0777.

        Unexpected exceptions from os.stat are not being hidden anymore.
